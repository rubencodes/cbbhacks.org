                <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
                <p>A hackathon is the greatest thing to happen to education since the Internet. Hacking isn't breaking into anything—it's breaking your ideas out of the confines of your mind, collaborating with your peers to build them and sharing that product with the world.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 text-left">
                <h3>Do I need to code?</h3>
                <p>No, you absolutely do not need to code! If you have an idea, are looking for an idea, want to help design a product, or help market a product, please come! You might meet a new friend, or perhaps even a new cofounder.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-4 text-left">
                <h3>Do I need a team?</h3>
                <p>Nope—Come to the event, and you'll be sure to find a team here in need of your skillset! Students from other NESCAC schools will be present, so you'll be sure to find someone working on a neat idea! Or, go at it solo!</p>
              </div>

              <div class="col-sm-4 text-left">
                <h3>How do I get there?</h3>
                <p>Most participating schools are able to provide funding for their own students' transportation. If you or your school have no means of transportation or transportation funding, we will try to work with you to get you here. But please, let us know if you're coming <a href="#RSVP">below</a>!</p>

              <div class="col-sm-4 text-left">
                <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                <p>Yourself, any tools you need (laptops, drawing pads, etc), comfortable (read: warm) clothes, a sleeping bag if you plan to sleep, and a desire to build something awesome! Food, drinks and snacks will be provided courtesy of our sponsors.</p>

              <div class="col-sm-4 text-left">
                <h3>Who will be there?</h3>
                <p>Students from NESCAC schools will make up the majority of our hackers. VCs, entrepreneurs, startup founders, and representatives from tech companies will provide guidance as you work on your products!</p>

                <h3>What do I win?</h3>
                <p>To paraphrase Albus Dumbledore, "Eternal Glory. That is what awaits the Student who wins the third annual CBBhacks competition, but to this that student must survive thirty-six hours of hacking. Thirty-six EXTREMELY AWESOME hours."</p>

                <p>In addition to professional conduct, and following the code of conduct of your home institution and Bowdoin College, we expect you to only work on hacks that you start <b>at the hackathon</b> and that use only public APIs available to everyone else. Trust us, we can tell. </p>
